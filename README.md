HealthSync addresses the pressing challenge of inadequate communication within the healthcare industry, particularly between local clinics and patients. We tackle limited infrastructural capacities and ineffective communication channels of smaller clinics, assisting patients to discover specialized clinics for individualized care.

HealthSync serves as a comprehensive platform connecting patients with clinics and doctors. It assists users in locating local or specialized clinics based on their health needs and facilitates secure sharing of medical records. This allows doctors to make accurate diagnoses and personalized treatment plans, effectively empowering patients to manage their own health profiles.

The front-end employs standard web technologies for an interactive user interface. Our robust back-end, built on Firebase, ensures secure storage and real-time data synchronization of health records, user profiles, and appointment details. An integrated, AI-powered recommender system model enhances the patient experience by suggesting relevant healthcare providers based on symptoms and medical history. The system also uses an OCR feature to interpret text in medical reports, creating backend context.

HealthSync contributes to economic and social sustainability by improving resource utilization, reducing unnecessary healthcare costs, and ensuring equitable access to healthcare services. Key benefits include:

- Streamlined Healthcare Access and Convenience: Simplifies appointment booking and patient data management, enhancing patient care and satisfaction.
- Personalized Healthcare: Provides tailored clinic suggestions based on input symptoms, improving treatment outcomes.
- Enhanced Patient-Doctor Interaction: Facilitates seamless communication, fostering stronger doctor-patient relationships and better health outcomes.

Since project inception, our team has devoted approximately 120-125 hours over 2.5 weeks to establish essential features. We estimate another month to complete the project, integrating advanced features, and ensuring a robust, user-friendly, and scalable platform. While timelines may adjust based on progress and challenges, our commitment to deliver a high-quality solution remains steadfast.

HealthSync, aiming to bridge the healthcare industry's existing communication gaps, is dedicated to enhancing the healthcare experience for all users.
